Negative indexes in Python are a feature that allows you to access elements in a sequence (like lists, tuples, or strings) from the end rather than the beginning. 
The main benefit of negative indexing is that it provides a convenient way to refer to elements at the end of a sequence without needing to know the exact length of the sequence.

Why Use Negative Indexes?

Convenience: When dealing with long sequences, negative indexes allow you to easily access elements from the end without calculating their positive index.

Flexibility: They make your code more readable and maintainable, especially when the length of the sequence can vary.

Common Patterns: Many algorithms and data processing tasks involve looking at the last few elements of a list or string, making negative indexing a useful tool.
